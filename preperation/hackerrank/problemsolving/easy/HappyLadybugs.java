 Happy Ladybugs is a board game having the following properties:
    The board is represented by a string, b, of length n. The ith character of the string,b[i] , denotes ith the cell of the board.
         If b[i] is an underscore (i.e., _), it means the ith cell of the board is empty.
         If b[i] is an uppercase English alphabetic letter (ascii[A-Z]), it means the ith cell contains a ladybug of color b[i].
         String b will not contain any other characters.

     A ladybug is happy only when its left or right adjacent cell (i.e.,b[i+1] ) is occupied by another ladybug having the same color.
     In a single move, you can move a ladybug from its current position to any empty cell.

 Given the values of n and b for games of Happy Ladybugs, determine if itâ€™s possible to make all the ladybugs happy. For each game, print YES on a new line if all the ladybugs can be made happy through some number of moves. Otherwise, print NO.

 As an example,b=[YYR_B_BR] . You can move the rightmost B and R to make b=[YYRRBB_] and all the ladybugs are happy.
